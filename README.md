# ADC_library_rp2040
Embedded C library for RP2040 (RPi Pico) built in ADCs

RP2040 MCU has 3 12 bit ADC's built in along with a fourth temperature sensor.  This library allows easy integration of this feature into RP2040 based C projects. 

the minicom pico is a bash script that allows a simple serial monitor to be shown on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system. Not sure it will work with other linux builds--maybe w some fanagling.
